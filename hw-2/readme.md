# HW-2 Response

When I was first doing this was **frustrated** and couldnt find anything. and that was super annoying. I hoenstly wanted to throw my computer out the window.
BUT then I found a few things and **slowly** starting putting peices together. But
I still kept hitting walls and couldn't move forward which just made me more frustrated.
Then I went into see the proffessor and he made sense of a lot of it and So then I was able to move forward. Yay me.

I then learned how to do a list like this

- list 1
- list 2

And then one like this

1. one
2. two
3. three
  4. 1 A
  5. 2 A
    - 2 A
    - 2 B


  Inline code, like directory names can be done with backticks (i.e. `hw-2/`)

  If I want something to be **bold** I use two astricks.

And then I learned how to do a screenshot and that was great.

  I was shown how to do a lot of things and I am excited to learn more. I am very interested in coding and becoming a better artist. I realize there is a really long road ahead of me. But with wednesday visits I am sure that I can figure it all out and become a very good student and coder eventually.
