# HW-2 Response

When first doing this was frusterated and couldnt find anything.

- list 1\
- list 2


1. one
2. two
3. yeah!
  4. herr
  5. heyr
    - dr
    - der


  Inline code, like directory names can be done with backticks (i.e. `hw-2/`)

  If I want something to be **bold** i use two astricks.
