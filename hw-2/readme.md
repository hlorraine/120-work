# HW-2 Response

During this past week, I learned how to do basic tasks in my command-line interface, PowerShell.When I was first doing this was **frustrated** and couldnt find anything. and that was super annoying. I honestly wanted to throw my computer out the window. I spent a lot of time in trying to just find what I was supposed to be doing and do it. That was a lot of googling and messing with Atom and the command-line.

But then I found a few things and **slowly** starting putting the peices together. I set up the various programs--GitHub Desktop, Atom. But,
I still kept hitting walls and couldn't move forward, which just made me more frustrated.
Then I went into see the proffessor and he made sense of a lot of how everything works together and then I was able to move forward. Yay me.

I learned how to do a list like this

- list 1
- list 2
1. one
2. two
3. three
  4. 1 A
  5. 2 A
    - 2 A
    - 2 B

I learned how to title my documents within the command line and use that to navigate the folders.

  Inline code, like directory names can be done with backticks (i.e. `hw-2/`)

I also learned how to do some of the more basic coding.

  Such as if I want something to be **bold** I use two astricks.

And then I learned how to do a screenshot and that was great.

  I was shown how to do a lot of things and I am excited to learn more. I am very interested in coding and becoming a better artist. I realize there is a really long road ahead of me. But with wednesday visits I am sure that I can figure it all out and become a very good student and coder eventually.
