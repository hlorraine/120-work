1. Essentially I worked on creating an animated object through code. Which in itself was not difficult. However what i did find difficult was when I tried to connect to a browser and look at the work I was doing. I followed the instructions and downloaded the browser application in atom. But the open in browser tab still has yet to appear. So I am very confsed on that.
2. I watched the videos within the assignment and I followed the instructions along with looking up a fe wthings on the internet. I also went to see the proffessor for help.
3. I had a few problems as I explained in question 1.
4. I would like to discuss further some of the small animating codes. Such as a circle or a square. And even how to make a bunch of small circles move around the page.
5. I wasn't much help with figuring out issues with my classmates mostly because I couldn't figure out many things myself.
